# Find Two Non-overlapping Sub-arrays Each With Target Sum

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `target`.

You have to find **two non-overlapping sub-arrays** of `arr` each with a sum equal `target`. There can be multiple answers so you have to find an answer where the sum of the lengths of the two sub-arrays is **minimum**.

Return *the minimum sum of the lengths* of the two required sub-arrays, or return `-1` if you cannot find such two sub-arrays.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [3,2,2,4,3], target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: Only two sub-arrays have sum = 3 ([3] and [3]). The sum of their lengths is 2.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [7,3,4,7], target = 7
Output: 2
Explanation: Although we have three non-overlapping sub-arrays of sum = 7 ([7], [3,4] and [7]), but we will choose the first and third sub-arrays as the sum of their lengths is 2.

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: arr = [4,3,2,6,2,3,4], target = 6
Output: -1
Explanation: We have only one sub-array of sum = 6.

```

 

**Constraints:**

- 1 <= arr.length <= 105
- 1 <= arr[i] <= 1000
- 1 <= target <= 108

```java
class Solution {
    public int minSumOfLengths(int[] arr, int target) {

        int n = arr.length;

        int[] best = new int[n];

        // INF means no valid subarray found yet
        int INF = n + 1;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            best[i] = INF;
        }

        int left = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        int ans = INF;

        for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {

            sum += arr[right];

            // Shrink window if sum becomes too large
            while (sum > target) {
                sum -= arr[left];
                left++;
            }

            // Current window has sum == target
            if (sum == target) {

                int len = right - left + 1;

                // Is there a previous non-overlapping subarray?
                if (left > 0 && best[left - 1] != INF) {
                    ans = Math.min(ans, len + best[left - 1]);
                }

                // Store the shortest target subarray seen so far
                if (right == 0) {
                    best[right] = len;
                } else {
                    best[right] = Math.min(best[right - 1], len);
                }

            } else {

                // No target subarray ending here
                if (right > 0) {
                    best[right] = best[right - 1];
                }
            }
        }

        return ans == INF ? -1 : ans;
    }
}
